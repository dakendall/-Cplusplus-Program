# -Cplusplus-Program

__Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.__
    In this project, I created a working clock and the user can add one second, minute or hour. This can help the user keep track and change time.
    
__What did you do particularly well?__
I think the organization is my strong suit. This makes it easy to read and understand for other programmers. It also helps me keep track of where everything is and it is easy to follow.

__Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?__
To enhance my code, I could add a class instead of it all being in one. Another way to improve the code would be to add another lanuage like Python so I can use Python's strengths where C++ is weak.

__Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?__
The hardest part for me was trying to understand how to start writing the code. I look up several videos and I looked at some codes that others wrote. I eventually found a video that I was able to understand. After that, I was able to write the entire code. 

__What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?__
I think the understanding of infinite is something I would be able to transfer to other projects. It was interesting to learn how it was used to create an accurate clock. I think the use of loops will help me with other projects.

__How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?__
The program is organized and neat. It makes it easier to read. I also have comments throughout the code so if it will be easy to maintain.
